# Project Abstract

## &#8226; The Problem

Modern-day web browsers are pretty standardized and come with a certain guarantee that if a web page works in one browser, it will work in another web browser too except for a few minor cases. However, this is not true for email clients yet.

## &#8226; Current state of the problem

The developer community is thus aligned to certain tricks and hacks to make sure the emails sent are properly rendered by these different email clients.
There is no such package that solves this problem of creating responsive emails easily which can also handle cross browsers and clients compatibility issues.

## &#8226; Proposed solution to this problem

The end goal will be to implement a React-based component and utility methods-based lightweight library to provide a common interface for email building that users can install and use to build clean and responsive emails easily.

## &#8226; What is React Email?

### About our package

React-based component and utility methods-based lightweight library to provide a common and easy interface for clean and responsive email building.

# Work Summary

We started the React Email Project from scratch this summer. From initializing the package, to implementing CI/CD, creating components and utility methods, writing tests and stories using Storybook, creating documentation, and finally publishing the package on NPM - we did all of these in just 13 weeks. We also created a docs page using Docusaurus and deployed it on Netlify along with the Storybook and TypeDoc documentation. Also, we have used TypeScript for the whole project to make it more robust, reliable, and typesafe for the users. We have also used ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting the codebase. We started by finalizing the Task breakdown and creating the project roadmap. We also finalized the approach for creating the components and utility methods in several meetings. I learnt a lot of new things while working on this project under the guidance of my mentor. You can find the detailed work summary in the [GSoC Blogs](#gsoc-blogs) and the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/leopardslab/projects/3).
